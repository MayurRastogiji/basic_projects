## 📖 **Getting Started**

To get started with any of these projects, simply navigate to the respective folder and follow the instructions provided in the project's README file or comments within the code.

## 📊 **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed on your system to run the projects:

- **C Projects**: GCC compiler or any other C compiler.
- **Java Projects**: JDK (Java Development Kit).
- **Python Projects**: Python interpreter.

## 🌐 **How to Run**

### 🔢 **C Projects**
1. Navigate to the `C` folder.
2. Open a terminal and compile the C file using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc project1.c -o project1`).
3. Run the compiled program (e.g., `./project1`).

### 💻 **Java Projects**
1. Navigate to the `Java` folder.
2. Open a terminal and compile the Java file using `javac` (e.g., `javac Project1.java`).
3. Run the compiled program using `java` (e.g., `java Project1`).

### 🤖 **Python Projects**
1. Navigate to the `Python` folder.
2. Open a terminal and run the Python file using the Python interpreter (e.g., `python project1.py`).
