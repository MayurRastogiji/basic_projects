2. and explore more in JAVA folder

## Getting Started

To get started with any of these projects, simply navigate to the respective folder and follow the instructions provided in the project's README file or comments within the code.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system to run the projects:

- For C projects: GCC compiler or any other C compiler.
- For Java projects: JDK (Java Development Kit).
- For Python projects: Python interpreter.

## How to Run

### C Projects
1. Navigate to the `C` folder.
2. Open a terminal and compile the C file using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc project1.c -o project1`).
3. Run the compiled program (e.g., `./project1`).

### Java Projects
1. Navigate to the `Java` folder.
2. Open a terminal and compile the Java file using `javac` (e.g., `javac Project1.java`).
3. Run the compiled program using `java` (e.g., `java Project1`).

### Python Projects
1. Navigate to the `Python` folder.
2. Open a terminal and run the Python file using the Python interpreter (e.g., `python project1.py`).
